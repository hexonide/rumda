## Installation (Fedora)

> [!NOTE]
> If you're on Fedora, you could let my installer get all the packages automatically.
>


> [!CAUTION]
> \[don't delete or change the position of the repo after using the following command\]
>
> Use this one-liner to clone and install:
>

```bash
cd ~/.config && git clone --depth=1 https://github.com/hexonide/rumda && cd rumda && chmod +x install.sh && ./install.sh
```
and you'll be done!

## For other distros

> In case you're on a different distro, or you want to do it manually, or in case a package fails to install, here are the names:


```
hyprland quickshell rofi alacritty awww thunar neofetch swappy grim zathura yazi jetbrains-mono-fonts hyprpicker neovim \
ghostty  nautilus  btop bpytop obs-studio slurp xdg-desktop-portal-hyprland wl-clipboard git\
 jq lz4-devel lua python3 brightnessctl playerctl wpctl pipewire wireplumber
```

Recommended:
```
Firefox toolbar theme by Looma: https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/rumda/ 
Nvchad (cleanly manage your themes)
borders-plus-plus hyprland plugin (for the double borders)
And lastly, something to setup the custom discord theme.
```

> you can also edit the install.sh file to only install replace the configs you want, by making some vars at the top = false.
> and you can edit it to install the old pistachio theme, though it's unmaintained, so I don't recommend that.

> Configuring your own changes in the rice & possible issues

<details>
<summary>Things that may cause issues</summary>

        
> If something isn't working, make sure you have installed quickshell, hyprland, awww, and other dependencies correctly. it could also be that you're missing one of the recommended dependencies [here](#for-other-distros).
>
> 
>
> you can go to rumda/common/quickshell/shared/Common.qml to change things like dashboard pfp, github account name (for the dashboard), as well as default bar theme. 
>
>MORE IMPORTANTLY if your dashboard has weird sizes because of the difference between my screen size and yours, you can tweak the dashboardWidth / height values in that same Common.qml file.
>
> 
</details>



<details>
<summary>Basic configuration</summary>

> you can go to rumda/common/quickshell/light/config/Colors.qml to edit colors, same goes for .../dark/config/Color.qml
> 
> I don't recommend messing with them *too much* though
>
</details>



<details>
<summary>configuring further</summary>

> it would be better to make changes in the rumda dir itself, as the files at .config are just symlinked to there.
> you can then use any of the theme scripts in rumda/scripts/ to push your updates into place, in case they didn't
> get pushed there on their own. Please open an issue here if you need further guidance.
